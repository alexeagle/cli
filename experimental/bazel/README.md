# Bazel build events reader

Right now this is in an experimental folder until we know where to include it in the CLI.

The build_events.protobin was generated by running
`bazel test //internal/... --build_event_binary_file=../launchableinc/cli/build_events.protobin`
in a clone of https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs

Eventually we want to run a grpc server that bazel streams the events to, so this is temporary.

It is run like this:

```
% python3 experimental/bazel/parse_build_events.py experimental/bazel/build_events.protobin
Test Result test_action_output {
  name: "test.log"
  uri: "file:///private/var/tmp/_bazel_alex.eagle/6e198640a926b256bc76b9977cfe83fc/execroot/build_bazel_rules_nodejs/bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/testlogs/internal/common/test/copy_to_bin_tests/test.log"
}
test_action_output {
  name: "test.xml"
  uri: "file:///private/var/tmp/_bazel_alex.eagle/6e198640a926b256bc76b9977cfe83fc/execroot/build_bazel_rules_nodejs/bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/testlogs/internal/common/test/copy_to_bin_tests/test.xml"
}
...
```
